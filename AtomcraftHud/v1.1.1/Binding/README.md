Atomcraft HUD
=============

This folder contains the bindings for the Atomcraft HUD library.
This is currently bound to version [1.1.1 of the library](http://www.atomcraft.de/blog/2010/12/29/atomhud-1-1-1/)

Please help and fix any bugs/issues that you see.

Build
===== 
Navigate to this directory in terminal and run the following command
	/Developer/MonoTouch/usr/bin/btouch Atomcraft.cs Enum.cs
This will produce you a Atomcraft.dll which you can use in your MonoTouch projects.

You will also need to make sure you have the libAtomHUD.a in your project
and the correct extra arguments set in your iPhone Build section. 

There will be a sample project to go with this in the future.
